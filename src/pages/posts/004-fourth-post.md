Mark Knopfler is returning from a three-year hiatus on November 9th with the release of Down The Road Wherever, his ninth solo album. “The album features 14 new songs inspired by a wide range of subjects,” reads a press release, “including Knopfler’s early days in Deptford with Dire Straits, a stray soccer fan lost in a strange town, the compulsion of a musician hitching home through the snow and a man out of time in his local greasy spoon diner.”
